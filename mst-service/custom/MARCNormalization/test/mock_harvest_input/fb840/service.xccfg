#*****************************************
# This section maps 006 / 008 offset 05 values to the audience
# they should be associated with.
#
# For example, The line "a = Preschool" says that the
# audience is "Preschool" if the 006 (or 008) offset 05 is "a"
#
# Any of the mappings may be changed based on your organization's
# cataloging policies.  New properties may be added for 008 offset 05
# values not represented below, and unwanted mappings may be deleted

In this folder is the raw output from the 0.2.9 system.  It is not in the
exact format that I needed, so I created a one-time converter script
to make sure that the 0.3.0 system produced the same output as the 0.2.9
system.  Here are the steps I followed:

1) run ./scripts/conv/norm_output_1.sh
2) run ./scripts/conv/norm_output_diff_1.sh
3) eyeball "out2" file to see if there are any real diffs
   if there are, take a look the the "out" file
4) the only real diffs are that the old system didn't fully dedup
   I manually eyeballed each one to make sure.
5) I then copied out and out2 to the files orig-186-0.2.9.diff and 
   orig-186-0.2.9.mod.diff respectively

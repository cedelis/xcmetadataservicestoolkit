The record is missing an 001 control field.  If this record has associated holdings data (either embedded in a bibliographic record or separate MARC holdings records) then an 001 control field is required.   Options for adding 001 fields for records from an ILS that lack them include creating a custom data populate script or using a utility supplied by the ILS vendor.

#*****************************************
# This section maps 007 offset 00 and 01 values to the SMD type term
# they should be associated with.
#
# For example, The line "ad = atlas" says that the SMD
# Type is "atlas" if the 007 offset 00 is "a" and 007 offset 
# 00 is "d"
#
# Any of the mappings may be changed based on your organization's
# cataloging policies.  New properties may be added for 007 values 
# not represented below, and unwanted mappings may be deleted

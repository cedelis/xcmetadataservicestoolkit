# This section maps 007 offset 00 values to the DCMI Type
# they should be associated with.
#
# For example, The line "a = image" says that the DCMI 
# Type is "image" if the 007 offset 00 is "a"
#
# Any of the mappings may be changed based on your organization's
# cataloging policies.  New properties may be added for 007 offset 00
# values not represented below, and unwanted mappings may be deleted

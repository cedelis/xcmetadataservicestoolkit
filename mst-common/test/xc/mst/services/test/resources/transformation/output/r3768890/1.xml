    <dcterms:abstract>Llewelyn Moss is a Vietnam vet who could use a break. One morning while hunting antelope, he spies several trucks surrounded by dead bodies. He decides to examine the site. He finds a case filled with $2 million and a truck loaded with heroin. Moss takes it with him, tells his wife he's going away for awhile, and hits the road until he can determine his next move. On his the way from El Paso to the Mexican border, he discovers he's being followed by ex-special ops agent Chigurh. Chigurh's weapon of choice is a cattle gun, and he uses it on everyone who gets in his way. Just as Sheriff Bell, a World War II vet, is on Moss's trail, Chigurh's former colleague, Wells, is on his.</dcterms:abstract>
